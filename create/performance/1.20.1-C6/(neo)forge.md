[List of performance mods from TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods/blob/main/Performance/Performance120.md#forge-120x)

On 1.20.1 forge and neoforge mods are mostly interchangeable, try to avoid this if you can tho.

If you are playing multiplayer:<br>
Client mods are only needed on the client, you don't need to put this on a server.<br>
Server mods are only needed on the server end, if you are hosting with essential or e4mc then install them on your client.<br>
Both mods will be needed on both client and server for players to be able to join while they are present.

If you are playing singleplayer you can ignore the client, server, both tags.<br>
<br>

If you dont want to manually install the mods this is the recommended modpack: <br>

## If you want to use shaders:

If the shaderpack you use is on this list then you only need Iris, Create Better FPS and Colorwheel, if it isn't on this list then install Colorwheel Patcher alongside them:

    Euphoria Patches, since 1.7.0
    Eclipse (edit of Bliss, available on GitHub)
    Glimmer (available on GitHub)
    Shrimple (WIP, available on GitHub)
