# K2's Lists / Create / Performance / 1.16.5 / Forge

## Extra performance:

[List of performance mods from TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods/blob/main/Performance/Performance116.md#forge-116x)

If you are playing multiplayer:<br>
Client mods are only needed on the client, you don't need to put this on a server.<br>
Server mods are only needed on the server end, if you are hosting with essential or e4mc then install them on your client.<br>
Both mods will be needed on both client and server for players to be able to join while they are present.

If you are playing singleplayer you can ignore the client, server, both tags.<br>
<br>

No recommended modpack for 1.16.5. <br>
If you know any good packs send them to me (only performance mods, no content mods).
